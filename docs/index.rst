Hello everyone!

This is the beginning of a course on learning Linux operating systems and preparing for the RedHat system administrator certification exam. However, the main goal I set is to teach you how to work with Linux. I will try to make the course understandable for beginners and initially present information in the simplest language possible.

The RedHat exam is practical. It covers a range of topics necessary for an administrator, but not all topics. In the titles of the topics that need to be known for the exam, I will add the label "RHCSA", but the entire course will cover many more topics.

Since I will be explaining from scratch, I have set another goal - to make this course also for those who are completely unfamiliar with IT. For me, getting acquainted with operating systems is the first and very important step in becoming an IT professional. Therefore, for some, a series of topics may seem quite simple, but this will allow anyone who wants to understand IT.
